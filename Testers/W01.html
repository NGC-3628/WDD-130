    <h2>Isaac Iturralde Puente</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Torreon Mexico. 24 years old.
    </p>
    <h2>I go by Isaac or I or Iturralde or as you prefer <span>ðŸ˜†</span>.</h2>
    <p>Hello Y'all! I'm from Mexico and I always have been living here, and I am a big fan of astronomy. It started when
         I was in high school doing
        social service as a museum guide. So one of my dreams is to become a physicist and my plans are to become one by a master degree
         in applied technology into physics science. Since we are not able to have a sun within a nuclear reactor neither a black hole in our yard we relay onto computer programs and simulations. </p>
    <p> I served my mission in three different places when I was waiting for my missionary visa I got reassigned for one month in Mexico, then I went to Texas where was my original assignation, 
        unfortunately the COVID-19 put its foot in. So, I finished my calling in Pachuca Mexico. Serving in three different places it's something unique, and I feel very blessed of. 
        My favorite scripture is Alma 31:5 Living the gospel has a greater impact than anything else.</p>
    <p> I like to try playing guitar, read and learn something new due to I'm currently working as a high school teacher. I've made the decision to work and study because my girlfriend and I are planning to get married soon </p>
    <p> Before I served as a missionary I was studying mechanical engineering, I learned a lot of things from it, but I can tell you that it is not what I want to work for all my life </p>
    <p> Being enrolled in BYU pathway has been a turning point to the way that I in many of us study. What a blessing to be part of this institution.  </p>
